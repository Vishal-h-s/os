/* 3. Imagine an Emergency Medical Dispatch Center (EMDC) tasked with coordinating
emergency medical responses across a large urban area. The center receives calls about
various emergenciesâ€”accidents, medical crises, and urgent patient transfers. Identify
the algorithm helps prioritize shorter-duration tasks, allowing the center to quickly
dispatch assistance for multiple emergencies, potentially saving more lives by reducing
the response time.
Task Simulation:
Here are some examples of calls received by the EMDC one morning:
1.
Call A - Rapid response for a cardiac arrest at a home: Initial Burst Time = 7
minutes, Arrival Time = 08:00 AM
2.
Call B - Ambulance dispatch for a minor car accident: Initial Burst Time = 5
minutes, Arrival Time = 08:01 AM3.
Call C - Coordinate a helicopter for a critical transfer from a rural area: Initial Burst
Time = 3 minutes, Arrival Time = 08:02 AM
4.
Call D - Send paramedics to a multiple injury accident on a highway: Initial Burst
Time = 20 minutes, Arrival Time = 08:15 AM
5.
Call E - Dispatch an ambulance for a sudden stroke case: Initial Burst Time = 10
minutes, Arrival Time = 08:20 AM

// Identify the type of CPU scheduling algorithm for the scenario and implement the same
in C Language. Calculate Average Turn Around time and Average Waiting time for each of
the scheduling algorithm by taking arrival times accordingly.
//Calculate the times by using gantt chart in observation and crosscheck the same with
the output of the program.*/
